This project is a small application that renders data about users from a request to a public user api: [https://randomuser.me/](https://randomuser.me/). It uses React, jest for testing, and it requires you have both node and npm installed.

The user data renders in a table with columns for first name, last name, country of origin, date of birth, and a dynamic field that calculates whether the user's birthday has occurred yet in this calendar year. The table is sortable on the columns for first name, last name, and country.
